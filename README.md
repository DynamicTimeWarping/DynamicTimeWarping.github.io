# DynamicTimeWarping website

This is the main webpage for the DynamicTimeWarping project, currently hosted at https://dynamictimewarping.github.io/

Pushes to this repo will trigger regeneration of the website.

API docs are also automatically built by this repo.

## Manual steps

These things are currently handled manually by copying them in the `docs` directory. These are handled by the `Makefile` in this repo.
