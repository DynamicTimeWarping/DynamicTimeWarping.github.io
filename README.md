# DynamicTimeWarping website

This is the main webpage for the DynamicTimeWarping project, currently hosted at https://dynamictimewarping.github.io/

Pushes to this repo will trigger regeneration of the website.

##Â Manual steps

Two things are currently handled manually by copying them in the `docs` directory. These
are handled by the `Makefile`.

 - API docs, generated locally
 - Thumbnails for py-images
